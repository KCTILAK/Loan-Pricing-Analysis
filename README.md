# Loan-Pricing-Analysis
This project analyzes loan performance and pricing using Lending Club Loan Data, aiming to evaluate loan risk, predict default probability, and optimize pricing strategies.

# Key Features
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  * Handling Missing Values: Dropped columns with excessive missing values and filled remaining gaps using appropriate strategies.
  * Feature Engineering: Created new predictive features from existing data to enhance model accuracy.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Loan Performance Trends: Analyzed default rates, interest rates, and loan grades.
  * Correlation Analysis: Identified key factors influencing loan repayment performance.
  * Visualization: Used charts and graphs to explore loan characteristics.
3. Loan Risk Prediction & Pricing Models
  * Machine Learning Models: Built models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict loan default risk.
  * Loan Pricing Optimization: Analyzed interest rate determination based on risk factors.

# Outcome
* Improved Loan Pricing Strategy: Optimized interest rates based on predicted risk.
* Enhanced Default Risk Prediction: Developed models to assess the likelihood of loan repayment.
* Business Impact: Supports lenders in making data-driven decisions to reduce financial risk.

# Technology Stack
* Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook for data analysis
* Machine Learning for risk prediction
